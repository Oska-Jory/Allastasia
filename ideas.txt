STEVES AWESOME IDEA!

-This can help with the economy, so yes, we can work on it now if anyone wants to.
-Player killing type of game(this is not a minigame)

-explanation
	If you've ever read stories about the wild west I'm sure you've heard of bounties. This is how this 
	will work. If someone wants another player dead, and they have some extra cash, they could certainly
	use this system to do it. First we have an NPC that we'll call the "Bounty Master" for now, then the 
	player goes to the bounty master and puts a bounty on the players head w/ the price they're paying. 
	The bounty master will record this in his "book" and then if another player talks to the bounty master
	they can view a list of bounties on players heads. This will probably be displayed on some sort of interface.
	A player can then accept the bounty, and it will be added to their notes interface as a un deleteable note.
	If the player happens to kill the target in the wilderness, they will get some sort of ticket(or just get a
	message on the targets death) which they can exchange for the money that was on the targets head. I think it
	would be a very fun, and worth while system for the server.
